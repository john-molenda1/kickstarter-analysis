Excel Kickstart Project

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze a variety of fundraisers that have taken place from 2009 - 2017. Using 
information like fundraising goal, amount pledged, parent category, subgateory, and launch date to determine how
that influenced the outcome of the project. Then, we will use this information to make a recommendation to Louise
to inform her future decisions in fundraising projects.

## Analysis & Challenges

## Results
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
1) The best month to launch a theater fundraising project is in May as there were 111 successful outcomes that month, with no significant increase in failed or canceled outcomes in May. 
2) There is a continued dropoff in the number of successful outcomes (and no decrease in failed/canceled ones) for the remained of the year. If you haven't launched your fundraised by May, then your fundraiser rapidly begins losing its chance of success.
