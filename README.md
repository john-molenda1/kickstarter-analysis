# kickstarter-analysis
Excel Kickstart Project

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze a variety of fundraisers that have taken place from 2009 - 2017. Using 
information like fundraising goal, amount pledged, parent category, subgateory, and launch date to determine how
that influenced the outcome of the project. Then, we will use this information to make a recommendation to Louise
to inform her future decisions in fundraising projects.

## Analysis & Challenges

## Results
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
1) The best month to launch a theater fundraising project is in May as there were 111 successful outcomes that month, with no significant increase in failed or canceled outcomes in May. 
2) There is a continued dropoff in the number of successful outcomes (and no decrease in failed/canceled ones) for the remained of the year. If you haven't launched your fundraised by May, then your fundraiser rapidly begins losing its chance of success.
### Outcomes Based on Goals
Fundraisers with a goal set at less than $1000 stands the greatest chance of success. As the goal increases, we see a steady decline in the likelihood of goal success until the 
goal reaches $30,000. Goal success reaches a second fead in the $35,000 - $44,999 range. However, once the goal is in excess of $45,000, the fundraiser stands essentially no chance of succeeding. 
### Dataset Limitations
We have no idea what external factors could have influenced the success or failure of a fundraiser. The fundraiser may have failed due to a terrible idea, a recession, or just poor execution. Similarly, campaigns may have succeeded due to a great idea, a great organizer, donors being in a great mood, etc. We just have no way of knowing how the data may be skewed by that. 
### Other possible tables/graphs
We could have greated a seperate pivot table that analyzed average percentage of goal pledged by date created, parent category, subcategory. From the current pivot chart, we don't know if the fundraiser failed by $1 or $100,000 as they're both showing up as failed (same scenario for cancelled and successful).
